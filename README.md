## Bulk User Story Creator for Azure DevOps

This script allows you to **bulk create User Stories** in **Azure DevOps** automatically from a **CSV file**.

- Each User Story can include:
  - Title (`Title`)
  - Description (`Description`)
  - Acceptance Criteria (`AcceptanceCriteria`)
  - Direct association to a **Feature** (`FeatureID`)

- The script connects through the **Azure DevOps REST API** using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** for secure authentication.

- It is ideal for quickly and consistently loading large batches of user stories into new projects or during backlog migrations.
